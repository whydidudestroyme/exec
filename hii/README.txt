this is NOT an actual camlock, its an autohotkey 1.1 script made to help u hit cool clips while running kodas with your friends
it resembles the look and feel of an external camlock while at the same time not injecting anything
it uses hexcodes and pixelsearch to look for certain pixels on your screen that it thinks are players

doesnt work that well for pubs, this is meant for running kodas and should only be used in private servers with everyones consent in the lobby

everytime u change ur config u have to rerun the ahk

for some reason everytime u rerun the ahk cam, the first time that u try to toggle it might flick and not start tracing, it supposed to be like that dw
-------------
for the best experience using ZyuL AHK "Camlock", use the ClientAppSettings.json fflags provided in #zyul-io-ahk-camlock
-------------
dont know how to use fflags? look it up on youtube
